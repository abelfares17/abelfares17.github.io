                <p>Climate change has been a major issue worldwide for a few decades now. 
                    As future engineers, our duty is to fulfill our jobs while being nature-friendly. 
                    Thus, climate fresk helped me achieve that and made me aware of our role in green energy transition. 
                    Moreover, we aimed to link several cards and to decide whether these were consequences or causes. 
                    You may view it as a low-interest activity but it made us realize we had a role to play for the environment's sake.
                    Throughout this workshop, we were handed several images which were composed of a title 
                    and an image at the recto and a description/definition at the verso. 
                    Therefore, each person had to sum up the card and the group decided its position on the board, 
                    thus leading to several discussions over some cards concerning different topics.
                    To sum it up, the climate fresk is a great way to sensitize young engineers like us, in dying need of foresight. 
                    It not only helped us better understand our environment and the key role we had to play but also initiated us to have debates over climate change while being concise and effective as a team.</p>

                <h2>King Kong diversity-inclusion play</h2>
                <p>I had the opportunity to attend this play named King Kong's Trial. 
                    This interactive play tackled several important issues such as sex abuse, consent, and sexism. 
                    Indeed, while actors were playing, a narrator would ask several questions concerning their behavior and their remarks. 
                    This play's aim was to make us notice if anything was going wrong and also question us about their behaviors, on whether they were tolerable or not.
                    Overall, there were 2-3 scenes that we discussed and overall it was interesting to see people had different insights on certain situations.

                <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
                <p>This entrepreneurship day was meant to promote a certain product as we were entrepreneurs. 
                    We first brainstormed the product we would sell. 
                    First, we had to study the market of this product and check if any company had a monopoly. 
                    It turned out we had some competitors but none with a monopoly, so we locked in the idea.
                    Then, we evaluated the costs of this product based on several factors and also backed up by sources. 
                    Furthermore, we also studied our targetted customer base so that we could estimate the final cost and if it would be profitable.
